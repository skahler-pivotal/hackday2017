-- STREAM (in-application): a continuously updated entity that you can SELECT from and INSERT into like a TABLE
-- PUMP: an entity used to continuously 'SELECT ... FROM' a source STREAM, and INSERT SQL results into an output STREAM
-- Create output stream, which can be used to send to a destination
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (ticker_symbol VARCHAR(4), sector VARCHAR(12), change REAL, price REAL, addTime timestamp);
-- Create pump to insert into output 
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
-- Select all columns from source stream
SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol, sector, change, price, rowtime
FROM "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001";
